## Usage

Download and type:

```sh
stow nvim-stable
```

For example, if you want to use the stable neovim configuration.

## Neovim

There are 2 versions of neovim configurations:

- `nvim`
- `nvim-stable`

This is due to `nvim` being used as a playground to test new configurations, whilst
`nvim-stable` being configurations that I'm more familiar with and have worked for me in the past.
