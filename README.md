## Usage

Download and type:

```sh
stow neovim-stable
```

For example, if you want to use the stable neovim configuration.

## Neovim

There are 2 versions of neovim configurations:

- `nvim-stable`
- `neovim-unstable`

This is due to `neovim-unstable` being used as a playground to test new configurations, whilst
`neovim-stable` being configurations that I'm more familiar with and have worked for me in the past.
